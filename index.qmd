title: "Copenhagen Introductory Course"

### Background:

This website contains the R teaching material that can be used (it is not compulsory) during the **Simulated Outbreak (SimOb) section of the Introductory Course module** of the EPIET (European Programme of Intervention Epidemiology Training), EUPHEM (European Public Health Microbiology) and MediPIET (Mediterranean and Black Sea Programme for Intervention Epidemiology Training) fellowships.

The SimOb is an 4-day exercise where fellows are provided a series of injects through which they will follow a 10-steps framework to investigate a specific outbreak. Some of the injects are dedicated to R-exercises that can be proved quite handy during an outbreak investigation. Those injects are maintained in this repository and are stored as different .qmd files, under the root folder:

-   `SimOb_RInject10.qmd`: focused on Data import and cleaning.
-   `SimOb_RInject11.qmd`: focused on Case definition.
-   `SimOb_RInject12.qmd`: focused on Laboratory data and descriptive analysis.
-   `SimOb_RInject15.qmd`: focused on Univariate analysis.
-   `SimOb_RInject16.qmd`: focused on Stratified analysis.
